# Project-1

Our group evaluated a data set that polled a population regarding their music listening habits and their self-reported levels of anxiety, depression
insomnia and OCD.

Given that this data set is about self-reported mental health, we must be careful when drawing any inferences or conclusions regarding the population. 
Thus, our group chose to frame our project and mindset as a research project. For the purpose of analysis, we imagined this poll was the first stage in
a series of evalutions to best understand our population and its relationship to mental health. Most importantly, for our final analysis, we're thinking
about how this data will shape the next steps in our research. 

e.g. What other questions would we want to ask to get a better understanding of a population? What data seems to have no statistical significnce and is it 
worth further inquiry? 

The questions we explored are as follows: 

1.	Is there a relationship between Rock Music and Metal Music and self-reported levels of mental illness?
From the data we can extrapolate that people who listen to both rock and metal have similar levels of depression, and OCD, which leads us to conclude that both these genres can be considered have an equal effect on people. However, people who listen to rock have higher levels of anxiety, contrasted to people who listen to metal who have higher levels of insomnia. An implicated hypothesis to consider would be that perhaps it is not a good idea to listen to metal before going to sleep. 
2.	If there a positive relationship between classic music and self-reported levels of mental illness?
The data allowed us to conclude that the population that listened to classical music have overall lower levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia and OCD, compared to rock and metal. Given that the anxiety levels are among the lowest ones across all genres, one can formulate hypothesis stating that classical music can have positive effects in lowering anxiety levels on people. 
3.	Is there any relationship between Rock music, Metal music, and Classical music and self-reported levels of mental illness?
It seems that in general, listening to classical music can be associated with lower levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia, compared to those who listen to rock and metal. It seems like there isn’t much correlation in terms of OCD, which is probably because this is a disorder not directly related to negative mental health effects.
4.	What is the statistical relationship for the percent of the population who listen to music during work hours and self-reported levels of anxiety?
Surprisingly, the data showed that people who do not listen to music while working or studying have in general lower levels of anxiety, than those who do. However, we would prefer to deepen this analysis in order to get a better understanding of the types of genres people listen to while working or studying, since as shown in the above, there are genres that are associated with lower levels of anxiety.
6. What’s the relationship between generations, listening to music, and the self reported level of anxiety, insomnia, and OCD?
  We can observe from the data that the young adults and adults suffer greater levels of anxiety and depression compared to teenagers. This analysis makes sense in the context that adults may have more stressors such as work, school, billings, healthcare, etc. It makes sense for teenagers to also suffer from high levels of anxiety, but having fewer responsiblities while at school-age. For further analysis, I'd want to look at how music impacts the level of anxiety and depression while performing specific tasks. If someone listens to music while doing school work, what's their self-reported severity of mental illness during those times. Doing this could provide more insight on how music impacts these mental illnesses.
6. What’s the relationship between the bpm of music and the self reported level of mental health illness?
  From our analysis, there seems to be no statistical relationship between BPM and self reported levels of mental illness. We can see higher levels of anxiety and depression all at tempos, but that also reflects our analysis in the previous question. We see high levels of anxiety and depression compared to insomnia and OCD. There could be little information to be gatheedr from future analysis. However, if we want to evaluate tempo, we could look at specific favorite songs or if people have prefered songs while expereince higher levels of mental illness. From this, we could potentially see if there is a relationship between specific instances of high mental illness and music. 
7. Is there any relationship between the favorite genres of the respondents and mental health conditions scale within different segments? 
   - Spotify is the most preferred choice accross the age groups with You tube being the next choice. Free music is preferred.
   - Rock is ranked as top fav genre across the age groups. Pop is ranked as second favorite for teenage and young adults but adults prefer metal music. 
     Amongst teenagers K-pop is quickly catching up along with Metal . Apart from Rock and Metal, adults have a diverese preference of music. 
   - Rock, Pop and Metal again is the top choice by this micro segments. People who have Low mental health scale are listening to diversified range of music
8. Does music help improve or worsen mental health conditions across different segments?
  Music definitely helps across all segments to improve their mental health
  Further more recurring data with respect to these respondents music listening behaviors and their mental health scale at that point will help us to understand 
  which mix of genres are helpful to improve their mental health condition 


Our analysis and final outputs can be found in the PowerPoint presentation and Output folder respectively.
